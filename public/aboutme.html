<p>
    When I'm not working on coding projects, I like to spend time<br/>
    on my other passions, whether from trying to get the highest rank<br/>
    the highest rank in a game, aim training to sharpen my reflexes and stability<br/>
    in game, and also pushing my limits with weightlifting. These hobbies<br/>
    make me who I am, and what make me push myself everyday.
